Salesforce Data Cloud enables the creation of a comprehensive Customer 360 data model by integrating data from various source systems. This model consolidates customer information from multiple platforms, including Salesforce standard objects like leads and contacts, as well as custom data from external sources such as Google Analytics, Facebook Meta Ads, SAP systems, Azure, and Google Cloud.

The Customer 360 data model encompasses both standard and custom objects, allowing organizations to tailor their data structure to meet specific needs. Data can be sourced from a wide range of systems, including traditional software, external databases, CRM systems, e-commerce platforms, marketing tools, email databases, customer service software, digital engagement channels (like websites and mobile apps), and analytical platforms (such as Tableau and Power BI).

To build this model, organizations must establish data streams that facilitate the flow of data into the Customer 360 framework. In previous sessions, the focus was on user setup and permissions within the Data Cloud, where users were assigned appropriate permission sets to access and manage the data effectively.

Overall, the Customer 360 data model provides a holistic view of customer interactions and data across various touchpoints, enabling better insights and decision-making.

Establishing Data Streams:

Data streams are essential for integrating data from source systems into the Data Cloud.
Each source system has specific objects (known as Data Source Objects or DSOs) that can be connected to the Data Cloud.
Examples of DSOs include leads, contacts, opportunities, and accounts.


Integration Process:

To bring data from Salesforce Sales Cloud into Data Cloud:
Enable Sales Cloud Starter Bundle:
Navigate to Data Cloud Setup and install the Sales Cloud Starter Bundle to access basic objects like leads, contacts, and accounts.

Set Up Data Streams:
> Go to Data Cloud Home and click on the option to create a new data stream.
> Select "Salesforce CRM" as the source.
> Choose the relevant Sales Cloud objects (e.g., leads, contacts, accounts) to establish the data stream.
> Select or deselect specific fields to be included in the data stream, noting that some fields are required and cannot be unchecked.
> After finalizing the selection, proceed to deploy the data stream.

Service Cloud Integration:
Similar to Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud Starter Bundle can be installed to integrate service-related objects (e.g., cases, tasks).
Users can also establish data streams for custom objects not included in the starter bundles by selecting "All Objects."

Final Steps:
Once the data streams are established, the integration process allows for seamless data flow from various source systems into the Data Cloud, enabling a comprehensive view of customer data.

This structured approach ensures that organizations can effectively integrate and manage their customer data across multiple platforms, enhancing their Customer 360 capabilities.


Summary of Establishing Data Streams and Data Lake Objects in Salesforce Data Cloud

Data Streams and Dependencies:
Establishing data streams is crucial for integrating data from various source systems into Salesforce Data Cloud.
Dependencies on fields must be resolved to successfully bring data from Service Cloud bundles into Data Cloud.
For example, while integrating Service Cloud, certain objects (like tasks) can be brought in without dependencies, while others may require additional steps to remove dependencies.


Categories of Data Objects:
When establishing data streams, objects are categorized into three main types:
> Profile Category: Contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about customers (e.g., first name, last name, email, phone number).
> Engagement Category: Includes data related to customer interactions with marketing communications (e.g., email opens, clicks, unsubscribes).
> Other Category: For data that does not fit into the above two categories.


Integration Process:
To integrate data from Service Cloud:
Select the appropriate object (e.g., task) and define its category.
Click "Next" and then "Deploy" to establish the data stream.

Note - Data streams create connections to data source objects but do not initially bring in data.

Data Lake Objects:
A data lake object is automatically created when a data stream is established. 
It serves as a container for the data that will be brought into Data Cloud.

Data lake objects are designed to manage large volumes of structured and unstructured data.
Initially, data lake objects may show zero records until data is fetched from the source.


Mapping Data:
After establishing data streams, it is essential to map data lake objects to the Customer 360 data model.
Mapping ensures that data is organized and accessible within the Data Cloud.
Standard objects (e.g., leads, contacts) are automatically mapped to corresponding data model objects (e.g., contact point email, contact point phone).

Individual Object:
The individual object is crucial for unifying customer profiles across different systems (e.g., Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud).
Mapping profile category data (like leads and contacts) to the individual object is essential for identity resolution, allowing for a single customer profile to be created.

Connecting Multiple Salesforce Orgs:
Organizations can connect multiple Salesforce orgs to Data Cloud to unify data from different sources.
This allows for a comprehensive view of customer data across various Salesforce environments.

Data Verification and Exploration:
After establishing data streams and mapping, users can verify the data in Data Lake objects.
Data Explorer can be used to explore the integrated data, ensuring that the data is correctly populated and accessible.

Next Steps:
Users are encouraged to create leads and contacts in their Salesforce orgs and connect them to Data Cloud.
Understanding the functionalities of - 
> establishing data streams, 
> creating data lake objects, 
> and mapping to data models is essential 
for further exploring identity resolution and other advanced features in Data Cloud.


This structured approach to establishing data streams and managing data lake objects in Salesforce Data Cloud ensures that organizations can effectively integrate and utilize their customer data for enhanced insights and decision-making.


Summary of Data Streams, Data Lake Objects, and Data Model Objects in Salesforce Data Cloud
Overview of Data Streams:

Data streams are established to integrate data from various source systems, such as Salesforce Sales Cloud and Service Cloud.
The integration process involves selecting the source Salesforce CRM, choosing the objects (e.g., leads, contacts), and defining their attributes.

Data Lake Objects:
When a data stream is created, a corresponding data lake object is automatically generated.
Data Stream: Represents the connection to a specific data source object (e.g., lead or contact).
Data Lake Object: Acts as a container for the metadata of the data source object, facilitating the actual data transfer into Data Cloud.


Data Model Objects (DMOs):
DMOs are in-house objects within Salesforce Data Cloud that mirror standard and custom objects from source systems.

Upon establishing a data stream, DMOs are created to organize and manage the data brought into Data Cloud.

Key DMOs include:
Contact Point Email: Stores email-related information.
Contact Point Phone: Stores phone-related information.
Contact Point Address: Stores address-related information.

Individual Object: Represents a unique person and centralizes all data related to that person across different data sources.

Mapping Process:
After establishing data streams, it is essential to map the data lake objects to the appropriate DMOs.
Mapping ensures that profile category data (e.g., leads, contacts) is correctly associated with the individual object, allowing for unified customer profiles.

The individual object is crucial for identity resolution, as it consolidates multiple records from different sources into a single profile.

Handling Multiple Salesforce Orgs:
Organizations can connect multiple Salesforce orgs to Data Cloud, allowing for the integration of leads and contacts from different sources. Even if the same person exists as a lead in one org and a contact in another, they will be treated as a single individual in Data Cloud.

Data Exploration:
Users can explore integrated data using the Data Explorer tool, which allows for viewing and editing the columns of data model objects.
The Data Explorer provides insights into how data from various data streams is mapped to a single lead or contact object.

Engagement Data:
Engagement data, which includes tracking interactions (e.g., email opens, clicks) from marketing communications, can also be integrated into Data Cloud. This data is typically sourced from Salesforce Marketing Cloud and is essential for creating a comprehensive view of customer interactions.

Importance of Individual Object:
The individual object plays a vital role in unifying customer data across different profiles and engagement records.
It allows organizations to manage and analyze customer data effectively, reducing duplication and improving marketing efficiency.

Next Steps:
The next phase involves integrating engagement data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud to further enhance the data structure within Data Cloud.
Understanding the mapping process and the significance of individual objects will be crucial for future sessions focused on data unification and identity resolution.

This structured approach to establishing data streams, creating data lake objects, and mapping to data model objects in Salesforce Data Cloud ensures that organizations can effectively manage and utilize their customer data for enhanced insights and decision-making.

Custom data extensions can contain specific subscriber information (e.g., subscriber key, first name, last name, email address, phone number, country).

Creating Data Streams for Custom Data:
To integrate a custom data extension (e.g., B41 profile), create a new data stream and select the appropriate business unit and data extension.
Specify the category of the data (e.g., profile) and select a primary key (e.g., subscriber key).

Mapping Data:
After creating a data stream for the custom data extension, you need to perform manual mapping to link the data lake object to the appropriate data model objects in Data Cloud.
Create a custom data model object that mirrors the attributes of the data extension (e.g., first name, last name, email, phone number, country). Map the custom data model object to the Individual Object to unify customer profiles across different data sources.

Linking to Individual Object:
The individual object is crucial for identity resolution, allowing for the consolidation of multiple records into a single customer profile. Map relevant attributes from the custom data model object to the individual object, ensuring that all profile-related data is linked correctly.

Finalizing Mapping:
After mapping the custom data model object to the individual object and other relevant DMOs (e.g., contact point email, contact point phone, contact point address), save the mappings.

Update the status of the data stream to initiate the data transfer process, which may take some time to complete.

Monitoring Integration:
While the data stream is running, you can monitor the integration of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud starter bundles and ensure that all data streams are being established correctly.
